# Dream Report 42

## Conversation

**User**: I want to make a short scientific report graphing together the evolution of the following variables through time.

- Carbon credit prices
- Biodiversity credit prices
- Cost of basic phone with camera
- Cost of descent camera component for phones (like the one used in advanced iPhone or Samsung phones).
- Cost of internet access for geographic area.

The objective of this report is to determine whether there is a geographical area, where the environmental revenue from selling carbon and biodiversity credits associated to that area is greater than the cost to bring a basic internet connection to the area.

**Assistant**: It seems like you're looking to create a complex data visualization that tracks the evolution of several variables over time. While the MixerBox ImageGen AI image generation tool can generate images based on descriptions, it's not designed to create data visualizations or graphs based on specific data sets.

For your project, you might want to consider using data visualization tools such as Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, or even Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn if you're comfortable with coding. These tools allow you to input your data and create a variety of graphs and charts to visualize the relationships between different variables.

If you have the data ready, I can help guide you on how to use these tools to create your desired visualization. If you don't have the data yet, I can assist you in finding potential sources or methods for gathering it.

**User**: I don't have the data yet, could you help me get that please?

**Assistant**: Sure, I can guide you on how to find the data you need. However, please note that I can't directly fetch or scrape data due to privacy and legal considerations. Here are some potential sources for the data you're looking for:

1. **Carbon credit prices**: You can find this data from various carbon market exchanges like the European Energy Exchange (EEX) or Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Some organizations also publish reports on carbon prices, such as the World Bank's "State and Trends of Carbon Pricing" report.

2. **Biodiversity credit prices**: This data might be more challenging to find as biodiversity credits are not as standardized or widely traded as carbon credits. You might need to look at specific programs or jurisdictions. For example, in Australia, the New South Wales government has a Biodiversity Offsets Payment Scheme.

3. **Cost of basic phone with camera**: You can find this data from various online retailers or databases that track mobile phone prices. Websites like Statista might also have relevant data.

4. **Cost of descent camera component for phones**: This could be challenging as well, as component costs are not typically disclosed by manufacturers. You might need to look at teardown reports from firms like IHS Markit, which estimate the costs of individual components.

5. **Cost of internet access for a geographic area**: This data can be found from various sources, including service providers, government reports, and databases like the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) or the World Bank.

Once you've gathered your data, you can use data visualization tools to create your graphs and analyze the relationships between these variables. Remember, data collection can be a time-consuming process, and the availability of data can vary greatly depending on the specific variable and region.

**User**: Perfect. Assume I already have the data for a particular geographical area. It is saved as an excel table with the following columns names and meanings.

- date: Date of the relevant data
- carbon_credit_price: Carbon Credit Price for that area.
- biodiversity_credit_price: Biodiversity Credit Price for that area.
- basic_phone_with_camera_price: Cost of basic phone with camera.
- camera_price: Cost of  the best camera component of the best phone sold 10 years ago.
- internet_cost: Cost of internet access in the particular geographical area for one basic phone throughout a whole year. Measured as 120 megabytes per year (or 10 megabytes per month).

I want to create a python script where you can input a json file with the locations and species of all the trees in a particular area. We call this file the area.json file. The python script then tells you whether there was a moment in time in which the following function was positive.

f(date) = f(carbon_credit_price(date, area.json), internet_cost(date, area.json)) = number_of_trees(area.json) * (carbon_credit_price(date, area.json) / 40)  - internet_cost(date, area.json)

Remember that one carbon credit represents all the carbon captured by a tree for 40 years. That is why I divide carbon_credit_price by 40 in order to get the value generated by one tree over a year. This way, this function compares the revenue that you can obtain from generating carbon credits of that area to the internet cost of doing the monitoring.

Give me a python script for doing this calculation. I want the python script to be called arbi.py.

**Assistant**: Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a basic Python script that should do what you're asking for. This script assumes that your Excel file is named 'data.xlsx' and is in the same directory as the script. It also assumes that your JSON file contains a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a tree and has a 'location' and 'species' key.

```python
import pandas as pd
import json

# Load the data from the Excel file
data = pd.read_excel('data.xlsx')

# Convert the 'date' column to datetime
data['date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['date'])

# Load the JSON file
with open('area.json') as f:
    trees = json.load(f)

# Calculate the number of trees
number_of_trees = len(trees)

# Define the function
def f(row):
    return number_of_trees * (row['carbon_credit_price'] / 40) - row['internet_cost']

# Apply the function to each row in the data
data['f_value'] = data.apply(f, axis=1)

# Find the dates where the function was positive
positive_dates = data[data['f_value'] > 0]['date']

# Print the dates
for date in positive_dates:
    print(date)

```
This script will print out the dates where the function was positive. If you want to do something else with these dates, you can modify the last part of the script.
