## Objective

The objective of this report is to determine whether there currently exists, has ever existed, or will exist a geographical area on Earth where the environmental revenue from selling carbon and biodiversity credits associated with that area exceeds the cost of establishing a basic internet connection in that area.

2. The report should be submitted along with the necessary `data.xlsx` and `area.json` files and Python scripts developed for the calculation of the function `f()` described in `dreams/dream_report_42.md`.
3. The data provided should be accurate, relevant, and should support the findings of the report.
4. A junior Python programmer should be able to verify the results of the report in under an hour.
